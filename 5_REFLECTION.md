# Final Assessment - Reflection

## Looking at the process of completing this assessment:

### 1. What did you do well

This time I was definitely better prepared and organised comparing to the previous exam. I was more calm and focus without stressing out I cannot do basic things.
Flow redux was much more understandable for me, the assignment was complex - I was making a lot of notes and plan on how to build the code and the flow behind it.
I had much more time to try more things and spend more energy on different functionalities. In case of any issues console.log was very helpful and I was able to fix it after some debugging.
Now I can also say that I should not have pass the first exam - I clearly see I did not have enough knowledge and understanding back in time. In other words I felt much more comfortable doing the assessment.

### 2. What would you do differently next time to improve

Since that was my second time I wanted to highlight again that passing the exam was much more accurate this time.
Looking at this now I need to work more on constrains because this time I lost some points.
I would need to be more focused on syntax because I had some cases like I typed in {id} but I should use just 'id', when I was building new columns I forgot about onDelete & onUpdate and than I could not remove artworks with their bids - these cases will definitely give me a good lesson for next projects. This is how I build the first experience.
